# App intro

This is a small ReactÂ app that shows a list of products to the user, and then the user can add products to their cart and change the quantity of the products in their cart. 

## Technologies used: 

React, redux, react-redux, react-router, typescript

*I consider this small project to be a part of the big real project, so I use Redux to center the states. Therefore, this project can be easily expanded in the future.*

## UI analyze
First, as default, you are on the home page screen. The navigation bar is on top, and it's available on all screens. In the navigation bar, there is a logon on the left and two buttons on the right. One button is for navigating to the home page and the other is for navigating to the cart page. On the home page screen, you can see a list of products. Each product card involves the image, name, and price of one product. It also has two buttons. One button is for navigating to the product details page, the one left is for adding the product to the cart.

On the product details page, you can see more details about the product. And you can also change the quantity and add the product to the card.

On the cart page, you see a table showing products added to the cart and their corresponding quantity. You can also change the quantity of each product if you want. If the quantity is less than or equal to zero, the product will be automatically deleted from the cart.
